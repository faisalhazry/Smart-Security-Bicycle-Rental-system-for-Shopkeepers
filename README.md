## Introduction (Project or Innovation)
A smart security bicycle rental system is a modern, technology-driven solution for renting bicycles. It involves using electronic locks and/or GPS tracking to secure the bikes, as well as digital payment systems for rent transactions. The goal is to provide a convenient, safe, and efficient way for people to rent bicycles for short periods of time, for both personal and commercial purposes. This type of system is often used in urban areas and tourist destinations, where there is a high demand for bike rentals. 
 The smart security bicycle rental system features cutting-edge technology designed to provide a secure, user-friendly, and efficient rental experience. The system includes a robust security system that ensures the safety of both the bicycles and the users, as well as a GPS tracking system that allows the bikes to be easily located and monitored in real-time. The system also includes a digital cloud logbook that provides a secure and transparent record of all rental transactions, ensuring that both the bikes and the users are properly accounted for. The system is further enhanced by a user-friendly app that provides easy access to all of the system's features and functionalities, making it simple and convenient for users to rent and return bikes. All of these features work together to provide a comprehensive and seamless smart security bicycle rental solution.

 ## Objective
 The objective of the project is to create a convenient user-friendly system that can perform certain functions. First, it allows bicycle shopkeepers to view the customersâ€™ location in real time. Besides, it should remind the customers of the remaining time and the shopkeeper will get a notification when the time is finished. This project is also aimed to make the whole renting process faster.
