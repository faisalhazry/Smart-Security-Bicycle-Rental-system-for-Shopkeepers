## 1.0.Introduction (Project or Innovation)
A smart security bicycle rental system is a modern, technology-driven solution for renting bicycles. It involves using electronic locks and/or GPS tracking to secure the bikes, as well as digital payment systems for rent transactions. The goal is to provide a convenient, safe, and efficient way for people to rent bicycles for short periods of time, for both personal and commercial purposes. This type of system is often used in urban areas and tourist destinations, where there is a high demand for bike rentals. 
 The smart security bicycle rental system features cutting-edge technology designed to provide a secure, user-friendly, and efficient rental experience. The system includes a robust security system that ensures the safety of both the bicycles and the users, as well as a GPS tracking system that allows the bikes to be easily located and monitored in real-time. The system also includes a digital cloud logbook that provides a secure and transparent record of all rental transactions, ensuring that both the bikes and the users are properly accounted for. The system is further enhanced by a user-friendly app that provides easy access to all of the system's features and functionalities, making it simple and convenient for users to rent and return bikes. All of these features work together to provide a comprehensive and seamless smart security bicycle rental solution.

 ## 1.1.Objective
 The objective of the project is to create a convenient user-friendly system that can perform certain functions. First, it allows bicycle shopkeepers to view the customers’ location in real time. Besides, it should remind the customers of the remaining time and the shopkeeper will get a notification when the time is finished. This project is also aimed to make the whole renting process faster.

 ## 1.2.Questionnaires
 A survey is conducted to a bicycle rental shopkeeper in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, and one in Danga Bay to better understand the needs of the shopkeeper.

## 1.3.Analysis of Data Collection
The data from the Google Form is thoroughly reviewed, and the findings are compiled on the Jamboard. The members then see through the responses and analyse them in different aspects, such as current situation, problem faced, potential solutions, and steep analysis.

## 1.3.1. Problem Statement
First, the rented bicycles can be misused and stolen. Besides, the customers can exceed the rental time. Moreover, a physical logbook is hard to manage as it is prone to natural disaster or loss. Last but not least, the shopkeepers cannot hold on to customers’ IC cards.

## 1.3.2. Needs
● Gps system
● To hire more staff to look after the customers
● Automatic alarm system

## 1.4.Design Statement
The goal is to help Bike Rental Shop Owner to prevent losing and misusing of their rented bicycles. For customers who do not return the bike, location tracking feature is needed to make the process of locating the bike much faster, hence reduces the possibility of losing potential customers due to the unattended counter because of short-staffed. The system also has a feature to prevent GPS system from being tampered. Furthermore, the system shows the customer their remaining rent time and distance traveled. Last but not least, the customer can immediately send a emergency signal to the shopkeeper if anything bad happen such as accidents or if the bike breaksdown.

## 5.3.Observation
The GPS system is able to send the location to a satellite. However, the GPS signal is not available in an indoor environment. The gps needs some time to send the signal when it is changed from indoor to outdoor. This situation may be due to the antenna used mainly for drones and it is not suitable for bicycle usage. For further improvement, we can change the antenna. The emergency system and security system are able to activate the buzzer. The application is able to receive signals of location. The application is also able to work correctly. However, the delay of signal transmissions is long, which is 40 seconds on average.

## 5.2 Conclusion
In conclusion, the system is able to function with some drawbacks. The GPS signal needs some delay to be sent and received. This can be improved by changing the antenna. The emergency and security systems and the application are functioning correctly. However, The signal transmissions are slow. The prototype should be further improved and tested so that it can meet the commercial requirement.
